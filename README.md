# Setting Up OpenAI API on Mac in Mainland China

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the OpenAI API on your Mac computer in mainland China.

## Requirements

- macOS (latest version recommended)
- Python 3.6 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)
- OpenAI API key
- A VPN service (depending on the internet restrictions)

## Steps

  **1.Install Python and pip**

   **Python and Pip Installation**
   
   _Mac OS X comes with Python 2.7 out of the box between versions 10.8 and 12.3. If your Mac OS X version is between these versions, you do not need to install or configure anything else to use Python 2. However, this version of Python is great for learning, but not suitable for development. The Python version that ships with OS X may be out of date from the official current Python release, which is considered the stable production version._

   To install a more recent version of Python and the package manager pip, follow these steps:

   Install GCC by downloading Xcode, the smaller Command Line Tools (you must have an Apple account) or the even smaller OSX-GCC-Installer package. If you already have Xcode installed, do not install OSX-GCC-Installer as they can cause issues together. If you perform a fresh install of Xcode, you will also need to add the command-line tools by running 
   ```shell
   $ xcode-select --install
   ```
   on the terminal.

   Install Homebrew, a package manager that fills a void in OS X. Open Terminal or your favorite OS X terminal emulator and run the following command:
   ```shell
   $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```


  **3. Install the OpenAI Python client**

   Open Terminal and run the following command:

   ```shell
   $ pip install openai
   ```

  **4. Get your OpenAI API key**

   You need to apply for an API key from OpenAI. Visit the OpenAI website and follow the steps to apply for access. If approved, you will receive an API key.

  **5.Setup your OpenAI API key**

   You should save your API key in your environment variables for easy access. In Terminal, run:

   ```shell
   echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'" >> ~/.bash_profile
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   _Replace your-api-key with your actual API key._

  **6. Verify the setup**

   You can verify the setup by running a simple script that uses the OpenAI API. Here's a basic example:

   ```python
   import openai
   
   openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   
   response = openai.Completion.create(
     engine="text-davinci-002",
     prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
     max_tokens=60
   )
   
   print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
   
   ```

   Save this script to a file, say test_openai.py, and run it using:

   ```shell
   python3 test_openai.py
   ```

  **7. Setting up a VPN**

   Depending on the current internet restrictions in China, you may need to use a VPN to access the OpenAI API. Choose a reliable VPN service, install it on your Mac and connect to a server. Please note that using a VPN should comply with local laws and regulations.

   Note
   Always ensure you are complying with all local laws and regulations when using services like the OpenAI API. If there are any changes in policy or new restrictions after this guide is written, please check the latest OpenAI policy or news for updates.
